This txt outlines what features are to be added to the game.

* deck:
  an array containing the names of all the cards in your deck.
  the deck should be an object that supports basic manipulation like shuffling,
  drawing from the deck etc.
  perhaps the deck could be a subclass of class cardContainer ,which would
  also include the graveyard, the hand etc.

* auto-reformatting of strings
  the text font should be resized base on teh size of thte string automatically.
